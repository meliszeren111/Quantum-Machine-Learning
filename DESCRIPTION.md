QML Projects

QML_Project1: Comparative Classification Analysis of Quantum, Hybrid, and Classical Machine Learning Models
This project implements and compares quantum, hybrid, and classical classification models—including Quantum Neural Networks, classical Neural Networks, and SVMs—for both binary and multi-class tasks, enhanced by two-local optimization techniques.

QML_Project2: Quantum Optimization and Benchmarking Study with QAOA and Deutsch-Jozsa Algorithms
This project focuses on implementing foundational quantum algorithms (Deutsch-Jozsa, QAOA), benchmarking their performance on real versus simulated quantum hardware, and applying gradient-free optimization methods like SPSA to improve algorithmic efficiency.

QML_Project3: Hybrid, Quantum, Classical Approaches for Binary and Multi-Class Classification Systems
This project establishes a modular quantum machine learning pipeline that systematically evaluates pure quantum, hybrid, and classical classifiers across binary and multi-class scenarios, unified under a two-local optimization framework for parameter tuning.
